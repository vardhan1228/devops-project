# devops-project
ðŸ‘‰ lets clone this repo  
ðŸ‘‰ switch to cloned repo and terraform configuration files path
```sh
cd src/main/resources
```
-  these all files consist of ec2 creation and cloneing the public git hub repo and deploying the appliaction through privisioners
- change the values in ## terraform.tfvars ## file 
- one more main procress is we need to generate the keys in local for connection ec2 by unsing provisioners 
- if you have alredy priavte key in your local just passs the priavte key path in provisoner connection block and commnet the key pair resource block 
- change the key name according your environment
```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```
- by unsing above commnd generate keys in cmd or if you have alredy existing keys plese use it 
## after that change the public key and peiavte key path in ec2.tf  resource block and provisoner.tf connction block files
- one more main thing you nedd to pass your cloud credantiels in terraform working dircictroy by using aws configure 
## if your keys alredy configured just ignore aews configure
```sh
Install AWS CLI    ## if alredy installed igonre it 
Create IAM user with required policy of ec2,s3,iam,vpc creation permisions 
Generate access and secret keys
Run aws configure to set up credentials
aws configure
```

## conclusion 
-- by unsing above configuration files i am done below tasks 
```sh
 1. Spins up an EC2 instance of a specific type
 2. Installs dependencies (Java, Git, etc.)
 3. Clones repo & deploys app from GitHub
 4. Tests if app is reachable via port 80
 5. Stops the instance after a set time (for cost saving)
```


## Devops asignment 2
- created s3.tf for s3 bucket creation and bucket readonly access policy
# 
- i am superated provisioners to superate file called as provioners.tf. iam writed two null resources one is for previous task and another one is for task two .
- In this second provisioner i am cloned the private repo from git hub static files repo and placed that files into s3 bucket
- if your end change the priavte repo cloning url here  
- creted one more file iam.tf. In this file i am creted s3 full a accees permisiion policy and crated ec2 role 
- logs.sh file is for to move specific log files to s3 bucket
- logs.service file refers to trigger the shutdown behaviours
- change the git pat token  and s3 bucket name in terraform.tfvars 
- and also change s3 bucket name in logs.sh
- in terraform.tfvars change to your git hub pat token
- and priavte repo url on the provisioner block
### change the terraform.tfvars file values according two your requirement  but take the os is amazon linux only because we have configured entire shell script to amazon linux only

- everthing is done just run the following commnds to build infra and all

```sh
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
